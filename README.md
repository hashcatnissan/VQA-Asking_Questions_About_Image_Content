# VQA-Asking_Questions_About_Image_Contents

VQA (Visual Question Answering) is a relatively new activity that requires algorithms to reason about the visual content of a picture in order to respond to a natural language question. VQA requires an algorithm to respond to text-based inquiries about photos. Because many open-ended replies comprise a few words or a closed set of options that may be supplied in a multiple-choice format, VQA adapts itself to automated review. To put it simply, the Visual Question Answering (VQA) job combines data processing issues with visual and linguistic processing challenges in order to answer basic 'common sense' questions regarding given images. VQA has piqued the interest of deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing researchers. In terms of issue formulation, existing datasets, assessment criteria, and algorithms, we have attempted to assess the current state of VQA. We used a tailored version of the "MSCOCO VQA v1 validation" and "MSCOCO VQA v2 validation" datasets.
